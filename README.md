# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-Movie-Reviews-Using-LSTM-Networks
In this project, I developed a deep learning model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie review dataset. The goal was to accurately classify movie reviews as positive or negative, harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Key aspects of the project include:

1.Dataset: Utilized the IMDb movie review dataset, consisting of 50,000 reviews split evenly into training and test sets, providing a balanced dataset for binary sentiment classification.
2.Data Preprocessing: Implemented tokenization and sequence padding to convert text data into a suitable format for neural network processing, ensuring uniform input size.
*Model Architecture: Designed a Sequential model in TensorFlow and Keras, incorporating an Embedding layer for NLP, an LSTM layer for sequence processing, and Dense layers with dropout and L2 regularization to combat overfitting.
*Overfitting Mitigation: Applied dropout, recurrent dropout, and L2 regularization techniques, along with early stopping based on validation loss, to enhance the model's generalization ability.
*Training and Evaluation: Achieved notable accuracy in classifying the sentiment of movie reviews, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in learning from textual data and its potential application in automated review analysis systems.

Skills and Tools Used:
*Languages and Libraries: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
*Techniques: Natural Language Processing, Sequence Modeling, Regularization Strategies
*Concepts: Deep Learning, LSTM Networks, Sentiment Analysis

Project Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrated the use of LSTM networks in processing and classifying text data, achieving a high level of accuracy in sentiment analysis. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in understanding complex human language patterns and provides a strong foundation for further exploration in automated text analysis and NLP applications.
